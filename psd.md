# Project Specification Document

## **Project Title**
**Unsupervised Deep Learning for Underground Water Leakage Detection Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data**

---

## **1. Introduction**
### **1.1 Project Overview**
This project focuses on leveraging **deep learning** to detect **underground water leakage** using post-processed **Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data**. By applying **unsupervised learning techniques**, we aim to identify **anomalous surface deformations and moisture patterns** indicative of water leakage.

### **1.2 Motivation**
- **Non-Invasive Leak Detection**: Traditional methods (e.g., excavation, acoustic sensors) are costly and time-consuming.
- **SAR’s All-Weather Capability**: Unlike optical sensors, SAR provides **day/night and all-weather monitoring**, making it ideal for infrastructure inspection.
- **Environmental & Economic Benefits**: Early detection can prevent **water loss, ground instability, and infrastructure damage**, reducing costs for municipalities and utility providers.

## **2. Problem Definition**
### **2.1 Problem Statement**
The objective is to train an **unsupervised deep learning model** that can detect anomalies in **SAR-derived features** that correlate with underground water leakage. The model will analyze:
- **Surface deformations** (from InSAR post-processing)
- **Soil moisture changes** (from Sentinel-1 backscatter data)
- **Temporal variations** to distinguish leaks from natural changes

### **2.2 Key Challenges**
- **Extracting useful SAR features** from post-processed Sentinel-1 data.
- **Reducing false positives** from seasonal or environmental factors.
- **Designing an efficient unsupervised model** (e.g., Autoencoders, GANs, or Clustering-based approaches).
- **Validating results** against real leakage data or ground truth measurements.

## **3. Dataset Description**
### **3.1 Data Source**
- **Sentinel-1 SAR Data** (from Copernicus Open Access Hub)
- **Interferometric SAR (InSAR) post-processed data** (deformation maps)
- **Soil moisture estimates** derived from Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficients
- **Ground truth leakage data** (if available from municipal records or simulations)

### **3.2 Features and Labels**
| Feature                     | Description                                             |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| InSAR Deformation Maps     | Measures ground displacement over time                 |
| Backscatter Coefficients   | Estimates surface roughness and moisture content       |
| Temporal Data Series       | Tracks changes across multiple Sentinel-1 images       |
| Ground Truth (Optional)    | Locations of confirmed leakage incidents               |

### **3.3 Data Preprocessing**
- **Speckle Noise Reduction** using adaptive filtering techniques.
- **Normalization** of SAR intensity values for consistency.
- **Time-Series Analysis** to track trends and eliminate transient variations.

## **4. Model Architecture**
### **4.1 Selected Model**
An **Autoencoder-based anomaly detection model**:
- **Input**: Processed Sentinel-1 SAR feature maps.
- **Encoder**: Extracts key spatial-temporal features.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs normal patterns; deviations indicate anomalies.
- **Output**: Heatmaps highlighting probable leakage locations.

Alternatively, **clustering methods** (e.g., DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models) could be explored to group abnormal areas without labeled data.

### **4.2 Loss Function & Optimization**
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) for Autoencoders, Variational Loss for VAEs.
- **Optimizer**: Adam (learning rate = 0.001)
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Training Epochs**: 50-100 (based on dataset size and convergence)

## **5. Training Strategy**
### **5.1 Training Process**
1. **Feature extraction**: Process SAR images into structured inputs.
2. **Train Autoencoder/Clustering model** on normal conditions.
3. **Detect anomalies** where reconstruction error is high or clustering fails.
4. **Validate results** against ground truth or secondary SAR data.

### **5.2 Evaluation Metrics**
- **Reconstruction Error** (for Autoencoders)
- **Clustering Compactness Score** (for unsupervised clustering)
- **False Positive Rate** (to minimize incorrect detections)
- **Comparison with Known Leak Data** (if available)
